# Learn Generative AI: 45-Day Discovery Workshop

**Master Generative AI through systematic, hands-on exploration** - No textbook copying, just original learning experiences designed for deep conceptual understanding.

## 🌟 Our Learning Philosophy

This workspace orchestrates a **45-day expedition** through generative AI fundamentals, architected for active exploration rather than passive absorption. Every piece of code, documentation, and interaction advances the mission of profound conceptual comprehension.

### Discovery-Driven Learning

- **Build Understanding Through Implementation**: Create working examples that illuminate concepts
- **Progressive Skill Development**: Each day builds systematically on previous knowledge
- **Original Content Only**: All materials crafted from first principles using our zero-copy methodology
- **Concept Bridge Building**: Explicit connections between related AI topics

### Structured Progression (45 Days, 5 Days/Week)

- **Week 1-2**: Generative AI foundations and basic concepts
- **Week 3-4**: Language models and tokenization deep dive
- **Week 5-6**: Embeddings and vector operations mastery
- **Week 7-8**: Advanced model architectures and attention mechanisms
- **Week 9**: AI agents and practical applications
