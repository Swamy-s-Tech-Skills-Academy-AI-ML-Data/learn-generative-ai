# Learn Generative AI: 60-Day Comprehensive Discovery Workshop

**Master Generative AI through systematic, hands-on exploration** - No textbook copying, just original learning experiences designed for deep conceptual understanding and production-ready skills.

## 🌟 Our Learning Philosophy

This workspace orchestrates a **60-day comprehensive expedition** through generative AI fundamentals to advanced agent development, architected for active exploration rather than passive absorption. Every piece of code, documentation, and interaction advances the mission of profound conceptual comprehension and practical mastery.

### Discovery-Driven Learning

- **Build Understanding Through Implementation**: Create working examples that illuminate concepts
- **Progressive Skill Development**: Each day builds systematically on previous knowledge
- **Original Content Only**: All materials crafted from first principles using our zero-copy methodology
- **Concept Bridge Building**: Explicit connections between related AI topics
- **Production Focus**: Learn through building real-world applications

### Comprehensive Progression (60 Days, 5 Days/Week)

- **Week 1-2**: Generative AI foundations and mathematical concepts
- **Week 3-4**: Tokenization and embeddings deep dive with hands-on workshops
- **Week 5-7**: Language models, attention mechanisms, and advanced architectures
- **Week 8-10**: AI agents - from concepts to production implementation
- **Week 11-12**: Advanced features, deployment, and capstone project
