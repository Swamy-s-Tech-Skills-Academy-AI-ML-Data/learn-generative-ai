# Learn Generative AI: 90-Day Systematic Discovery Workshop

**Master Generative AI through systematic, hands-on exploration** - Original learning experiences designed for deep conceptual understanding and production-ready skills.

## 🌟 Our Learning Philosophy

This workspace orchestrates a **90-day comprehensive expedition** through generative AI fundamentals to advanced agent development, architected for active exploration rather than passive absorption. Every piece of code, documentation, and interaction advances the mission of profound conceptual comprehension and practical mastery.

### Discovery-Driven Learning (30 Minutes Daily)

- **Build Understanding Through Implementation**: Create working examples that illuminate concepts
- **Progressive Skill Development**: Each day builds systematically on previous knowledge
- **Original Content Only**: All materials crafted from first principles using our zero-copy methodology
- **Concept Bridge Building**: Explicit connections between related AI topics
- **Accessible Learning**: 30-minute daily sessions (10 min reading + 15 min practice + 5 min reflection)

### Comprehensive Progression (90 Days, 5 Days/Week)

- **Week 1-4**: Generative AI foundations, tokenization, and embeddings
- **Week 5-8**: Language models, attention mechanisms, and advanced architectures  
- **Week 9-12**: AI agents - from concepts to production implementation
- **Week 13-16**: Advanced patterns, optimization, and real-world deployment
- **Week 17-18**: Capstone projects and portfolio development
