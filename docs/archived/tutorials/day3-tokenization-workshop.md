# Activate your discovery environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Verify tiktoken installation
python -c "import tiktoken; print('‚úÖ Tokenization tools ready!')"
```

```powershell
cd src\day3
python a1_countingtokens.py
```

## üî¨ Guided Discovery Experiments

### Experiment 1: Basic Tokenization Patterns

**Objective**: Discover how different text types affect tokenization.

**Method**: Use the pattern discovery mode (Option 1) to examine:

- Simple English sentences
- Technical terminology
- Mixed languages
- Numbers and symbols
- Repeated patterns

**Learning Questions**:

1. Which text type produces the highest character-to-token ratio?
2. How does punctuation affect token boundaries?
3. What happens with repeated words?

**Expected Discoveries**:

- English text typically achieves 3-4 characters per token
- Technical terms often split into meaningful components
- Punctuation creates separate tokens or merges with adjacent text

### Experiment 2: Interactive Tokenization Exploration

**Objective**: Develop intuition for tokenization behavior through hands-on testing.

**Method**: Use the interactive explorer (Option 2) to test:

```text
Test Cases for Exploration:
1. "Hello world!"
2. "Python programming"
3. "AI tokenization"
4. "Cost: $123.45"
5. "The quick brown fox jumps"
6. Your own creative examples!
```

**Discovery Process**:

1. Predict how many tokens each text will produce
2. Run the analysis and compare with your prediction
3. Examine the token breakdown to understand split points
4. Calculate efficiency ratios

**Learning Insights**:

- Common words often become single tokens
- Uncommon combinations split into subwords
- Spaces and punctuation create predictable patterns

### Experiment 3: Efficiency Optimization Challenge

**Objective**: Learn to write prompts that tokenize efficiently.

**Challenge**: Rewrite these prompts to use fewer tokens while preserving meaning:

```text
Original: "Please provide me with a comprehensive explanation of how artificial intelligence systems process natural language text."

Optimized: [Your turn - aim for 30% fewer tokens]

Original: "I would like you to analyze the following code and tell me what it does step by step."

Optimized: [Your turn - maintain clarity while reducing tokens]
```

**Success Metrics**:

- Reduced token count
- Preserved semantic meaning
- Maintained clarity for human readers

## üéì Concept Integration Exercises

### Exercise 1: Token Boundary Prediction

Before running tokenization, predict where text will split:

```text
Practice Text: "Preprocessing natural language data"

Your Prediction: Draw boundaries like this:
"Pre|process|ing |natural |language |data"

Actual Result: [Run through tokenizer to verify]
```

### Exercise 2: Cross-Language Efficiency Analysis

Compare tokenization efficiency across languages:

```python
# Test these phrases (all mean "Hello, how are you?")
test_phrases = {
    "English": "Hello, how are you?",
    "Spanish": "Hola, ¬øc√≥mo est√°s?",
    "French": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?",
    "German": "Hallo, wie geht es dir?",
}
```

**Analysis Questions**:

- Which language tokenizes most efficiently?
- How do special characters (¬ø, √ß, √ü) affect tokenization?
- What does this suggest about training data distribution?

### Exercise 3: Technical Term Decomposition

Explore how specialized vocabulary gets tokenized:

```text
Technical Terms to Analyze:
- "backpropagation"
- "convolutional"
- "transformer"
- "hyperparameter"
- "preprocessing"

Look for patterns in how complex terms split.
```

## üîç Advanced Discovery Challenges

### Challenge 1: Prompt Engineering Application

**Scenario**: You have a 100-token budget for a creative writing prompt.

**Task**: Design the most effective prompt for generating a short story about time travel.

**Constraints**:

- Must stay under 100 tokens
- Should include specific genre, tone, and character guidance
- Test multiple versions to optimize token efficiency

### Challenge 2: Code Tokenization Analysis

**Objective**: Understand how programming code tokenizes differently than natural language.

**Method**: Analyze tokenization of this Python snippet:

```python
def calculate_accuracy(predictions, labels):
    correct = sum(p == l for p, l in zip(predictions, labels))
    return correct / len(labels)
```

**Investigation Points**:

- How do Python keywords tokenize?
- What happens with function names and variable names?
- How does code structure affect token boundaries?

## üöÄ Practical Applications Workshop

### Application 1: API Cost Estimation

**Skill Development**: Learn to estimate costs before making API calls.

**Practice**: Calculate token costs for common tasks:

```text
Task Examples:
1. Summarizing a 500-word article
2. Translating a paragraph between languages
3. Generating code comments for a function
4. Creative writing based on a detailed prompt
```

### Application 2: Context Window Optimization

**Scenario**: You need to fit a conversation history, system prompt, and user query within a 4000-token limit.

**Challenge Components**:

- System prompt: ~200 tokens
- Conversation history: Variable
- User query: ~50 tokens
- Required response space: ~500 tokens

**Optimization Strategy**: How would you manage the conversation history to maximize context while staying within limits?
