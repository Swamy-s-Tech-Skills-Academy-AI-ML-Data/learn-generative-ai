# Agentic AI Patterns and Frameworks

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that exhibit **agency** - the ability to act autonomously, make decisions, and pursue goals with minimal human supervision. These systems go beyond simple input-output processing to demonstrate:

- **Intentionality**: Having goals and working toward them
- **Autonomy**: Operating independently without constant guidance
- **Adaptability**: Learning and adjusting strategies based on feedback
- **Persistence**: Continuing to work toward goals despite obstacles

## Core Patterns in Agentic AI

### 1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Pattern

The ReAct pattern combines reasoning (thinking through problems) with acting (taking concrete steps). This is the foundation of most modern AI agents.

**Structure:**

1. **Thought**: Agent reasons about the current situation
2. **Action**: Agent takes a specific action based on reasoning
3. **Observation**: Agent observes the result of the action
4. **Repeat**: Continue until goal is achieved

**Example Flow:**

```
Goal: Research the latest developments in quantum computing

Thought: I need to search for recent quantum computing news and research papers.
Action: Search for "quantum computing 2024 breakthrough research"
Observation: Found several articles about Google's new quantum chip and IBM's advances.

Thought: I should get more specific information about these developments.
Action: Search for "Google quantum computing chip 2024 specifications"
Observation: Retrieved detailed technical specifications and performance metrics.

Thought: Now I have enough information to provide a comprehensive summary.
Action: Compile research findings into a structured report.
```

### 2. Plan-and-Execute Pattern

This pattern involves creating a complete plan before execution, then following that plan step by step.

**Phases:**

1. **Planning**: Break down the goal into detailed steps
2. **Execution**: Execute each step in sequence
3. **Monitoring**: Check progress and adjust if needed
4. **Completion**: Verify goal achievement

### 3. Reflexion Pattern

Agents using this pattern can self-reflect on their performance and improve over time.

**Components:**

- **Actor**: Performs the main task
- **Evaluator**: Assesses the quality of the actor's work
- **Self-Reflection**: Generates insights for improvement
- **Memory**: Stores lessons learned for future use

### 4. Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern

Multiple specialized agents work together to achieve complex goals.

**Roles:**

- **Coordinator**: Manages overall workflow
- **Specialists**: Handle specific domain tasks
- **Validators**: Check quality and accuracy
- **Communicators**: Facilitate information exchange

## Building Agentic AI Systems

### Design Principles

1. **Goal-Oriented**: Clear objectives and success metrics
2. **Modular**: Separate concerns and reusable components
3. **Observable**: Transparent reasoning and action logs
4. **Controllable**: Human oversight and intervention points
5. **Robust**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Agent Core

```python
class AgentCore:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools, memory):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools
        self.memory = memory
        self.state = AgentState()

    def perceive(self, input_data):
        """Process environmental input"""
        pass

    def reason(self, context):
        """Generate reasoning and plans"""
        pass

    def act(self, action):
        """Execute actions in the environment"""
        pass

    def reflect(self, outcome):
        """Learn from results"""
        pass
```

#### 2. Tool Integration

```python
class ToolManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {}

    def register_tool(self, name, tool):
        """Register a new tool for agent use"""
        self.tools[name] = tool

    def execute_tool(self, tool_name, parameters):
        """Execute a tool with given parameters"""
        return self.tools[tool_name].execute(parameters)
```

#### 3. Memory Systems

```python
class AgentMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.short_term = []  # Recent interactions
        self.long_term = {}   # Persistent knowledge
        self.episodic = []    # Experience episodes

    def store(self, memory_type, content):
        """Store information in appropriate memory"""
        pass

    def retrieve(self, query, memory_type="all"):
        """Retrieve relevant memories"""
        pass
```
