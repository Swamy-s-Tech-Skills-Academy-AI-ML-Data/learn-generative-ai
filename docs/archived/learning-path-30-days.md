# Learning Path Moved

## Optional: 45‑day slower‑pace variant (5 days/week, ~30 min/day)

If you want smaller bites, split some heavier days:

- Fundamentals: break Day 3 into Probability/Loss (D3) and Sampling (D4), push others forward.
- Language models: split Training Process into Data/Preprocessing (D8) and Pretraining/Fine‑tuning (D9).
- Prompting: separate Evaluation (perplexity/BLEU/human eval) and Prompt Engineering basics into two days.
- Architectures: give ReAct, Plan‑and‑Execute, Reflexion each its own day; slide Frameworks to the next week.
- API reference: split LangChain basics vs custom tools/memory; split Function Calling into definitions vs execution loop.
- Memory: separate Hierarchical vs Vector memory.
- Deployment: separate FastAPI vs Docker/K8s.

Result: 9 weeks × 5 days ≈ 45 days with the same sources while keeping daily effort to ~30 minutes.
