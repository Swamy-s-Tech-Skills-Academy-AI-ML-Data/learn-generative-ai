# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your Generative AI learning journey! Here's how to get started immediately.

## ✅ Setup Complete

Your environment is ready:

- ✅ Virtual environment (`.venv`) created and activated
- ✅ Python 3.12.5 running
- ✅ Essential packages installed (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter)
- ✅ Project structure in place

## 🎯 Start Learning Right Now

### Option 1: Interactive Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)

```bash
# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Open: notebooks/day1/01_generative_ai_foundations.ipynb
```

### Option 2: Quick Python Script

```bash
# Run the basic concepts script
cd src/day1
python basic_concepts.py
```

### Option 3: Read the Theory

```bash
# Explore the documentation
# docs/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md
# docs/concepts/ai-agents.md
# docs/tutorials/genai-to-agents.md
```

## 📅 Your 4-Week Journey

| Week       | Focus                      | What You'll Build                |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Week 1** | Transformer Fundamentals   | Attention mechanism from scratch |
| **Week 2** | Transformer Implementation | Complete mini-transformer        |
| **Week 3** | LLM Training               | Fine-tuned language model        |
| **Week 4** | LLM Applications           | Production RAG system            |

## 🔄 Progressive Package Installation

We start minimal and add packages as needed:

**Currently Installed (Week 1):**

- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, requests

**Add Later:**

- Week 2: `torch` (for implementing transformers)
- Week 3: `transformers, tokenizers` (for pre-trained models)
- Week 4: `openai, langchain` (for LLM applications)

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Run Every Example** - Don't just read, execute the code!
2. **Experiment** - Modify parameters and see what happens
3. **Build Projects** - Apply concepts to your own ideas
4. **Take Notes** - This is your personal learning repository

## 🆘 Need Help?

- 📖 Check `docs/` folder for detailed explanations
- 🔍 Search the codebase for examples
- 💬 Remember: This is a marathon, not a sprint!

## 🎯 Ready? Let's Go
