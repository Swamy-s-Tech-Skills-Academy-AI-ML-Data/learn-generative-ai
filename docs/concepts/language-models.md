# Language Models

## What are Language Models?

Language models are AI systems designed to understand and generate human language. They predict the probability of word sequences and can complete text, answer questions, and engage in conversations.

## Evolution of Language Models

### Statistical Models (1980s-2000s)

- **N-gram models**: Predict next word based on previous n words
- **Limitations**: Short context, sparse data problems
- **Example**: "The cat sat on the \_\_\_" → "mat" (most common completion)

### Neural Language Models (2010s)

- **RNNs and LSTMs**: Sequential processing with memory
- **Word2Vec and GloVe**: Dense word representations
- **Improvements**: Better context understanding, semantic relationships

### Transformer Era (2017-Present)

- **Attention mechanism**: Process all words simultaneously
- **BERT**: Bidirectional understanding (2018)
- **GPT series**: Autoregressive generation (2018-2023)
- **Scale revolution**: Billions to trillions of parameters

## How Language Models Work

### Tokenization

Text is broken into tokens (words, subwords, or characters):

```python
# Example tokenization
text = "Hello, world!"
tokens = ["Hello", ",", " world", "!"]
token_ids = [15496, 11, 995, 0]  # Numerical representation
```

### Neural Architecture

#### Embedding Layer

- Converts tokens to dense vectors
- Learns semantic relationships
- Typically 512-4096 dimensions

#### Transformer Blocks

- **Self-attention**: Focus on relevant context
- **Feed-forward networks**: Process information
- **Layer normalization**: Stabilize training
- **Residual connections**: Enable deep networks

#### Output Layer

- Converts hidden states to vocabulary probabilities
- Softmax activation for probability distribution
- Vocabulary size: 50K-100K+ tokens

### Training Process

#### 1. **Data Collection**

```
Web pages + Books + Articles + Code → Training Dataset
```

- Massive text corpora (trillions of tokens)
- Diverse domains and languages
- Quality filtering and deduplication

#### 2. **Pretraining**

```python
# Simplified training objective
for each_token_sequence in dataset:
    for position in sequence:
        predicted_prob = model(sequence[:position])
        actual_token = sequence[position]
        loss += -log(predicted_prob[actual_token])
```

#### 3. **Fine-tuning**

- **Supervised Fine-tuning**: Task-specific datasets
- **RLHF**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- **Constitutional AI**: Self-correction and alignment

## Types of Language Models

### Autoregressive Models (GPT family)

- **Generation**: Left-to-right text generation
- **Strengths**: Excellent at creative writing, completion
- **Architecture**: Decoder-only transformers
- **Examples**: GPT-3, GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA

### Masked Language Models (BERT family)

- **Understanding**: Bidirectional context processing
- **Strengths**: Classification, question answering
- **Architecture**: Encoder-only transformers
- **Examples**: BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa

### Encoder-Decoder Models

- **Translation**: Sequence-to-sequence tasks
- **Strengths**: Translation, summarization
- **Architecture**: Full transformer with encoder and decoder
- **Examples**: T5, BART, mT5

## Model Architectures

### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

```
Input → Embedding → Transformer Blocks → Output Probabilities
```

- **Causal attention**: Only sees previous tokens
- **Autoregressive**: Generates one token at a time
- **Scalable**: Works well with increased size

### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations)

```
[CLS] tokens [SEP] → Transformer Encoder → Classification/Tasks
```

- **Bidirectional**: Sees full context
- **Masked training**: Predict randomly masked tokens
- **Task-specific heads**: Different outputs for different tasks

## Key Concepts

### Attention Mechanism

```python
# Simplified attention calculation
attention_weights = softmax(Q @ K.T / sqrt(d_k))
output = attention_weights @ V
```

- **Query, Key, Value**: Three projections of input
- **Self-attention**: Tokens attend to themselves
- **Multi-head**: Multiple attention patterns

### Context Window

- **Definition**: Maximum input length model can process
- **Current limits**: 4K-200K tokens (varies by model)
- **Challenges**: Quadratic memory/compute scaling
- **Solutions**: Sliding windows, sparse attention

### Temperature and Sampling

```python
# Temperature scaling
probabilities = softmax(logits / temperature)

# Sampling strategies
if strategy == "greedy":
    next_token = argmax(probabilities)
elif strategy == "random":
    next_token = sample(probabilities)
elif strategy == "top_k":
    next_token = sample(top_k(probabilities, k))
```

## Training Techniques

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Cleaning**: Remove low-quality content
2. **Deduplication**: Eliminate repeated text
3. **Filtering**: Language detection, content moderation
4. **Tokenization**: Convert text to model inputs

### Optimization

- **AdamW**: Adaptive learning rate optimizer
- **Learning rate scheduling**: Warmup and decay
- **Gradient clipping**: Prevent exploding gradients
- **Mixed precision**: FP16/BF16 for efficiency

### Distributed Training

- **Data parallelism**: Split batches across GPUs
- **Model parallelism**: Split model across devices
- **Pipeline parallelism**: Stage-wise processing
- **Zero optimization**: Memory-efficient training

## Capabilities and Limitations

### Strengths

- **Versatility**: Multiple tasks without retraining
- **Few-shot learning**: Learn from examples
- **Code understanding**: Programming and logic
- **Multilingual**: Support many languages

### Weaknesses

- **Hallucination**: Generate false information
- **Inconsistency**: Different outputs for same input
- **Lack of grounding**: No real-world knowledge updates
- **Computational cost**: Expensive to run and train

## Evaluation Metrics

### Perplexity

```python
perplexity = exp(-1/N * sum(log(P(token_i | context))))
```

- Lower perplexity = better language modeling
- Measures how "surprised" model is by text

### BLEU Score

- Measures n-gram overlap with reference
- Common for translation and generation
- Range: 0-100 (higher is better)

### Human Evaluation

- **Fluency**: How natural does text sound?
- **Coherence**: Does content make sense?
- **Factuality**: Is information correct?
- **Helpfulness**: Does it meet user needs?
