# Daily Learning Guides

This directory contains structured daily learning guides designed to support your 90-day generative AI learning journey.

## ðŸŽ¯ 30-Minute Daily Structure

Each daily guide follows this optimized format:

- **ðŸ“– Reading Focus (10 minutes)**: Targeted concept study
- **ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)**: Interactive hands-on exercises  
- **ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)**: Synthesis and preparation

## ðŸ“… Week 1: Generative AI Introduction (Days 1-5)

| Day | Topic | Focus | Key Skills |
|-----|-------|-------|------------|
| [Day 1](day01-genai-intro.md) | What is Generative AI | Fundamentals & characteristics | Define GenAI, identify applications |
| [Day 2](day02-genai-overview.md) | How GenAI Works (Overview) | Training vs generation | Understand the two-phase process |
| [Day 3](day03-key-components.md) | Key Components & Architecture | System building blocks | Map components, control quality |
| [Day 4](day04-probability-basics.md) | Mathematical Foundations I | Probability basics | Explain probability in language modeling |
| [Day 5](day05-loss-functions.md) | Mathematical Foundations II | Loss functions | Describe what loss optimizes |

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Success Tips

### Before Each Day

- [ ] Review previous day's reflection notes
- [ ] Have notebook and concept docs ready
- [ ] Set timer for 30 minutes

### During Learning

- [ ] Follow the 10-15-5 minute structure
- [ ] Take notes on key insights
- [ ] Complete all interactive exercises
- [ ] Don't rush - depth over speed

### After Each Day

- [ ] Update your learning journal
- [ ] Identify 1-2 key takeaways
- [ ] Note any questions for later
- [ ] Prepare for tomorrow's focus

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Begin with [Day 1](day01-genai-intro.md)**
2. **Open the [Week 1 Notebook](../notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb)**
3. **Set your 30-minute timer**
4. **Follow the structured learning path**

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

### Week 1 Milestones

- [ ] Day 1: Can define generative AI clearly
- [ ] Day 2: Understand training vs generation
- [ ] Day 3: Map GenAI system components  
- [ ] Day 4: Explain probability in text generation
- [ ] Day 5: Connect loss functions to learning

### Weekly Assessment

After Day 5, you should be able to:

- Distinguish generative from discriminative AI
- Explain the complete GenAI workflow
- Identify quality control mechanisms
- Understand mathematical foundations
- Design basic GenAI system architecture
