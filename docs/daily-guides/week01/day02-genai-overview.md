# Day 2: How GenAI Works (Overview) (30 min)

## ðŸ“– Core Concepts (10 minutes)

### How Generative AI Works

#### 1. **Training Phase**

```text
Large Dataset â†’ Neural Network â†’ Learned Patterns
```

- Feed massive amounts of data to neural networks
- Network learns statistical relationships
- Captures patterns, context, and structure
- **Example**: Show millions of text examples, AI learns grammar, facts, reasoning patterns

#### 2. **Generation Phase**

```text
Input Prompt â†’ Model Processing â†’ Generated Output
```

- User provides input (prompt)
- Model uses learned patterns to generate response
- Output reflects training data patterns
- **Example**: Given "The weather is", AI predicts "sunny", "cloudy", etc. based on learned patterns

#### 3. **Key Components**

##### Neural Networks

- **Transformers**: Current dominant architecture
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on relevant parts of input
- **Parameters**: Billions of learned weights (like memory)

##### Training Data

- **Scale**: Trillions of tokens/images
- **Quality**: Carefully curated and filtered
- **Diversity**: Multiple domains and styles

### Key Questions to Answer

1. What are the two main phases of generative AI systems?
2. How does training differ from generation?
3. What role does data play in the training process?

## ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)

**Notebook**: [`week01-comprehensive-practice.ipynb`](../../../notebooks/weekly/week01/week01-comprehensive-practice.ipynb)

- **Section**: "Day 2: Training vs Generation"
- **Activities**:
  - Explore training data examples
  - Visualize the learning process
  - Understand pattern recognition

### Hands-on Tasks

- [ ] Sketch the high-level training concept
- [ ] Explore training data examples in the notebook
- [ ] Run the "pattern learning" simulation
- [ ] Review training vs generation comparison

## ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)

### Daily Reflection Prompts

1. **Process Understanding**: Describe the training process in 2-3 sentences
2. **Pattern Recognition**: What patterns might AI learn from your domain's data?
3. **Quality Factors**: What makes training data "good" vs "poor"?
