# Day 1: What is Generative AI (30 min)

## ðŸ“– Core Concepts (10 minutes)

### What is Generative AI?

Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to AI systems that can create new contentâ€”text, images, audio, video, or codeâ€”based on patterns learned from training data. Unlike discriminative AI that classifies or predicts, generative AI produces novel outputs.

### Key Characteristics

#### 1. **Creativity and Novelty**

- Generates content that doesn't exist in training data
- Combines patterns in new ways  
- Produces human-like outputs

#### 2. **Pattern Learning**

- Learns statistical patterns from massive datasets
- Understands context and relationships
- Generalizes to new situations

#### 3. **Probabilistic Nature**

- Outputs are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Same input can produce different outputs
- Temperature controls randomness vs consistency

### Generative vs Discriminative AI

| Discriminative AI | Generative AI |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Classifies/Predicts** | **Creates/Generates** |
| Email spam filter | ChatGPT text generation |
| Image recognition | DALL-E image creation |
| Medical diagnosis | GitHub Copilot code |
| Stock price prediction | Music composition AI |

### Key Questions to Answer

1. What distinguishes generative AI from discriminative AI?
2. What are the 3 main characteristics of generative AI?
3. How does generative AI create new content?

## ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)

**Notebook**: [`week01-comprehensive-practice.ipynb`](../../../notebooks/weekly/week01/week01-comprehensive-practice.ipynb)

- **Section**: "Day 1: GenAI Fundamentals"
- **Activities**:
  - Explore examples of generative vs non-generative AI
  - Identify generative AI outputs in your daily life
  - Test basic text generation concepts

### Hands-on Tasks

- [ ] Run the GenAI classification exercise
- [ ] List 3 generative AI applications you use
- [ ] Complete the generative vs discriminative comparison

## ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)

### Daily Reflection Prompts

1. **Application**: Write down 3 concrete outputs you want GenAI to produce in your domain
2. **Understanding**: In one sentence, explain generative AI to someone non-technical
3. **Next Steps**: What aspect of GenAI are you most curious about?
