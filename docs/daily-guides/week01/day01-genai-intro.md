# Day 1: What is Generative AI (30 min)

## ðŸ“– Reading Focus (10 minutes)

**Primary Source**: [`do../archiv../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md`](../archiv../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md)

- **Focus sections**: Introduction + Key Characteristics
- **Goal**: Understand what makes AI "generative" vs other AI types

### Key Questions to Answer

1. What distinguishes generative AI from discriminative AI?
2. What are the 3 main characteristics of generative AI?
3. How does generative AI create new content?

## ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)

**Notebook**: [`notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb`](../../notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb)

- **Section**: "Day 1: GenAI Fundamentals"
- **Activities**:
  - Explore examples of generative vs non-generative AI
  - Identify generative AI outputs in your daily life
  - Test basic text generation concepts

### Hands-on Tasks

- [ ] Run the GenAI classification exercise
- [ ] List 3 generative AI applications you use
- [ ] Complete the "probability basics" interactive demo

## ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)

### Daily Reflection Prompts

1. **Application**: Write down 3 concrete outputs you want GenAI to produce in your domain
2. **Understanding**: In one sentence, explain generative AI to someone non-technical
3. **Next Steps**: What aspect of GenAI are you most curious about?
