# Day 4: Mathematical Foundations I - Probability Basics (30 min)

## ðŸ“– Reading Focus (10 minutes)

**Primary Source**: [`do../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md`](../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md)

- **Focus sections**: "Mathematical Foundation" (probability section only)
- **Goal**: Understand probability's role in language modeling

### Key Questions to Answer

1. Why is probability fundamental to generative AI?
2. How do probability distributions work in language models?
3. What does "next word prediction" really mean mathematically?

## ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)

**Notebook**: [`day04-probability-basics.ipynb`](../../../notebooks/weekly/week01/day04-probability-basics.ipynb)

- **Probability Distribution Explorer**: Interactive visualization of uniform, normal, softmax, and attention distributions
- **AI Prediction Analysis**: See how AI models use softmax to convert raw scores into probabilities
- **Attention Weight Visualization**: Understand how AI "pays attention" to different parts of input
- **Real AI Examples**: Explore actual probability distributions used in classification and sequence modeling

### Hands-on Tasks

- [ ] Run the `explore_probability_distributions()` function to see comprehensive probability visualizations
- [ ] Analyze the softmax distribution showing AI model predictions for animal classification
- [ ] Study the attention weight distribution to understand sequence processing
- [ ] Compare uniform vs normal vs softmax distributions and their AI applications
- [ ] Verify that probabilities sum to 1.0 in softmax and attention examples

## ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)

### Daily Reflection Prompts

1. **Probability Understanding**: How does probability help AI generate text?
2. **Prediction Logic**: Why doesn't AI always pick the most likely word?
3. **Mathematical Intuition**: What probability concepts surprised you?
