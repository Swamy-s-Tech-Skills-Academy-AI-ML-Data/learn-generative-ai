# Week 1: Generative AI Introduction

**Welcome to your first week of systematic AI discovery!** This week establishes foundational understanding through 5 focused daily sessions.

## üéØ Week 1 Overview

**Focus**: Build core understanding of what generative AI is, how it works, and its key mathematical foundations.

**Time Commitment**: 30 minutes daily (10 min reading + 15 min practice + 5 min reflection)

**Learning Objective**: By Friday, you'll understand generative AI fundamentals and be ready for deeper technical exploration.

## üìÖ Daily Schedule

| Day | Topic | Key Question |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| [Day 1](day01-genai-intro.md) | What is Generative AI | What makes AI "generative" vs "discriminative"? |
| [Day 2](day02-genai-overview.md) | How GenAI Works (Overview) | What's the difference between training and generation? |
| [Day 3](day03-key-components.md) | Key Components & Architecture | What are the building blocks of GenAI systems? |
| [Day 4](day04-probability-basics.md) | Mathematical Foundations I | How does probability drive text generation? |
| [Day 5](day05-loss-functions.md) | Mathematical Foundations II | What does "learning" mean mathematically? |

## üî¨ Hands-on Practice

**Primary Notebook**: [Week 1 Exploration](../../../notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb)

This comprehensive notebook supports all 5 days with:

- Interactive code examples for each concept
- Visualization of key principles  
- Hands-on exercises to reinforce learning
- Progress checkpoints and self-assessment

## üèÜ Week 1 Success Milestones

By the end of Week 1, you should be able to:

- [ ] **Define generative AI** clearly and distinguish it from discriminative AI
- [ ] **Explain the training vs generation phases** and their different objectives
- [ ] **Map the key components** of GenAI systems and their interactions
- [ ] **Understand probability's role** in text generation and language modeling
- [ ] **Connect loss functions** to the learning process and model improvement

## üìà Learning Tips for Success

**Before starting each day:**

- Review your previous day's reflection notes
- Set a 30-minute timer for focused learning
- Have both the daily guide and notebook open

**During each session:**

- Follow the structured 10-15-5 format
- Take notes on key insights
- Complete all interactive exercises in the notebook
- Don't rush - depth beats speed

**After each session:**

- Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned
- Note any questions for future exploration
- Check off completed milestones

## üîó Supporting Resources

**When you need deeper understanding:**

- [Generative AI Fundamentals](../../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md) - Detailed theoretical background
- [Language Models](../../archived/concepts/language-models.md) - Mathematical foundations
- [Hello World Example](../../../src/a1/helloworld.py) - Your first AI code

**Next week preview:**

- Week 2 will dive deeper into tokenization and text processing
- You'll build more complex examples and explore real model architectures
- The mathematical foundations from Week 1 will become practical tools
