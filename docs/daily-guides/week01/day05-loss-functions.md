# Day 5: Mathematical Foundations II - Loss Functions (30 min)

## ðŸ“– Reading Focus (10 minutes)

**Primary Source**: [`do../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md`](../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md)

- **Focus sections**: "Mathematical Foundation" (loss functions)
- **Goal**: Understand what language modeling loss optimizes

### Key Questions to Answer

1. What is a loss function and why is it important?
2. How does the loss function guide AI learning?
3. What specifically does language modeling loss optimize?

## ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)

**Notebook**: [`notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb`](../../notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb)

- **Section**: "Day 5: Loss Functions & Optimization"
- **Activities**:
  - Calculate simple loss functions
  - Visualize loss optimization
  - Understand training dynamics

### Hands-on Tasks

- [ ] Describe what language modeling loss optimizes
- [ ] Run basic example in `src/a1/helloworld.py`
- [ ] Calculate loss for different predictions
- [ ] Visualize loss function behavior

## ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)

### Daily Reflection Prompts

1. **Loss Understanding**: How does loss function guide learning?
2. **Optimization Insight**: Why do we minimize loss rather than maximize accuracy?
3. **Week Synthesis**: How do all Week 1 concepts connect?
