# Day 5: Mathematical Foundations II - Loss Functions (30 min)

## ðŸ“– Reading Focus (10 minutes)

**Primary Source**: [`do../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md`](../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md)

- **Focus sections**: "Mathematical Foundation" (loss functions)
- **Goal**: Understand what language modeling loss optimizes

### Key Questions to Answer

1. What is a loss function and why is it important?
2. How does the loss function guide AI learning?
3. What specifically does language modeling loss optimize?

## ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)

**Notebook**: [`day05-loss-functions.ipynb`](../../../notebooks/weekly/week01/day05-loss-functions.ipynb)

- **Loss Functions Explorer**: Interactive comparison of MSE, MAE, Huber, and Cross-Entropy loss functions
- **Gradient Visualization**: See how different loss functions provide learning signals through gradients
- **Training Simulation**: Observe how learning rate affects training stability and convergence speed
- **Real Training Dynamics**: Explore realistic training curves showing fast learning, steady improvement, and fine-tuning phases

### Hands-on Tasks

- [ ] Run the `explore_loss_functions()` function to see comprehensive loss function comparisons
- [ ] Analyze how MSE, MAE, and Huber losses behave differently with prediction errors
- [ ] Study the cross-entropy loss for classification problems and understand why it's preferred
- [ ] Examine gradient plots to understand how loss functions guide model learning
- [ ] Review training simulations showing good vs poor learning rate choices

## ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)

### Daily Reflection Prompts

1. **Loss Understanding**: How does loss function guide learning?
2. **Optimization Insight**: Why do we minimize loss rather than maximize accuracy?
3. **Week Synthesis**: How do all Week 1 concepts connect?
