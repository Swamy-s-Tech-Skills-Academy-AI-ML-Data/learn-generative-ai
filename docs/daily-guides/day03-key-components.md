# Day 3: Key Components & Architecture (30 min)

## ðŸ“– Reading Focus (10 minutes)

**Primary Source**: [`docs/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md`](../concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md)

- **Focus sections**: "Key Components" section
- **Goal**: Understand the building blocks of GenAI systems

### Key Questions to Answer

1. What are the main components of a generative AI system?
2. How do these components work together?
3. What quality levers can you control?

## ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)

**Notebook**: [`notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb`](../../notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb)

- **Section**: "Day 3: System Architecture"
- **Activities**:
  - Explore component relationships
  - Interact with quality controls
  - Study architecture diagrams

### Hands-on Tasks

- [ ] List 2 quality levers you can control
- [ ] Study architecture diagrams in the notebook
- [ ] Test different quality settings
- [ ] Map components to real-world systems

## ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)

### Daily Reflection Prompts

1. **Architecture**: Which component seems most important for your use case?
2. **Quality Control**: How would you prioritize speed vs quality?
3. **System Design**: What would your ideal GenAI system look like?
