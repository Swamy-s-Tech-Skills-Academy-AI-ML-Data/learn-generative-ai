# Day 2: How GenAI Works (Overview) (30 min)

## ðŸ“– Reading Focus (10 minutes)

**Primary Source**: [`do../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md`](../archived/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md)

- **Focus sections**: "How Generative AI Works" (first half)
- **Goal**: Understand the high-level training concept

### Key Questions to Answer

1. What are the two main phases of generative AI systems?
2. How does training differ from generation?
3. What role does data play in the training process?

## ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)

**Notebook**: [`notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb`](../../notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb)

- **Section**: "Day 2: Training vs Generation"
- **Activities**:
  - Explore training data examples
  - Visualize the learning process
  - Understand pattern recognition

### Hands-on Tasks

- [ ] Sketch the high-level training concept
- [ ] Explore training data examples in the notebook
- [ ] Run the "pattern learning" simulation
- [ ] Browse introduction cells in `notebooks/day1/01_generative_ai_foundations.ipynb`

## ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)

### Daily Reflection Prompts

1. **Process Understanding**: Describe the training process in 2-3 sentences
2. **Pattern Recognition**: What patterns might AI learn from your domain's data?
3. **Quality Factors**: What makes training data "good" vs "poor"?

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

By the end of Day 2, you should be able to:

- [ ] Explain the difference between training and generation phases
- [ ] Describe what happens during model training
- [ ] Identify what makes good training data
- [ ] Sketch the basic GenAI workflow
