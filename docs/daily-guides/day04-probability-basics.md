# Day 4: Mathematical Foundations I - Probability Basics (30 min)

## ðŸ“– Reading Focus (10 minutes)

**Primary Source**: [`docs/concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md`](../concepts/generative-ai-fundamentals.md)

- **Focus sections**: "Mathematical Foundation" (probability section only)
- **Goal**: Understand probability's role in language modeling

### Key Questions to Answer

1. Why is probability fundamental to generative AI?
2. How do probability distributions work in language models?
3. What does "next word prediction" really mean mathematically?

## ðŸ”¬ Notebook Practice (15 minutes)

**Notebook**: [`notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb`](../../notebooks/weekly/week01/genai-exploration.ipynb)

- **Section**: "Day 4: Probability in Practice"
- **Activities**:
  - Work through probability examples
  - Visualize probability distributions
  - Understand prediction mechanics

### Hands-on Tasks

- [ ] Explain probability in language modeling (2 sentences)
- [ ] Practice simple probability examples
- [ ] Visualize word prediction probabilities
- [ ] Test probability concepts with text

## ðŸ¤” Reflection & Planning (5 minutes)

### Daily Reflection Prompts

1. **Probability Understanding**: How does probability help AI generate text?
2. **Prediction Logic**: Why doesn't AI always pick the most likely word?
3. **Mathematical Intuition**: What probability concepts surprised you?
