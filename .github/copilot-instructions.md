# Copilot Blueprint for AI Discovery Workshop

Welcome to our generative AI discovery workspace! This blueprint helps GitHub Copilot understand our distinctive learning methodology and provide assistance calibrated to systematic AI concept mastery.

## Our Discovery Charter

This workspace orchestrates a 9-week expedition through generative AI fundamentals, architected for active exploration rather than passive absorption. Every piece of code, documentation, and interaction should advance the mission of profound conceptual comprehension.

### Learning Methodology
- **Discovery Through Construction**: Build understanding via incremental implementation
- **Principle-Driven Coding**: Every script illuminates a specific AI foundation
- **Spiral Mastery**: Revisit concepts with escalating sophistication
- **Problem-Focused Learning**: Bridge theory to practical challenges you'll encounter

### Workspace Organization
Our discovery environment organizes learning into specialized zones:
- `src/` houses functional implementations that illuminate concepts transparently
- `notebooks/` delivers interactive investigation environments for experimentation  
- `docs/` contains our systematic curriculum and reference materials
- `.github/` preserves development methodologies and prompt collections

## Code Crafting Protocols

### For Learning Transparency
When generating code, prioritize comprehension over optimization:
- Write functions that expose their internal logic through descriptive naming
- Include intermediate variables that reveal computational progressions
- Add verification statements that help learners validate their mental frameworks
- Design examples that degrade gracefully with instructive failure messages

### AI-Specialized Implementation Frameworks
- **Token Analysis**: Reveal vocabulary strategies, encoding selections, and boundary management
- **Vector Mathematics**: Showcase dimensionality impacts and similarity interpretations  
- **Model Composition**: Decompose layer interactions and information pathways
- **Agent Orchestration**: Unveil decision-making sequences and state transitions

### Custom Code Examples for Learning
When writing educational code, create self-documenting implementations:

```python
def explore_tokenization_impact(text_samples: List[str], tokenizer_name: str) -> None:
    """
    Educational function that demonstrates how tokenizer choices affect downstream processing.
    Shows vocabulary size, token count variations, and special token handling.
    """
    print(f"🔍 Analyzing tokenization with {tokenizer_name}")
    
    # Step 1: Load tokenizer and show basic info
    tokenizer = load_tokenizer(tokenizer_name)
    print(f"   Vocabulary size: {tokenizer.vocab_size:,}")
    print(f"   Special tokens: {tokenizer.special_tokens}")
    
    # Step 2: Process each sample and explain differences
    for i, text in enumerate(text_samples, 1):
        tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)
        print(f"\n📝 Sample {i}: '{text[:50]}...'")
        print(f"   → {len(tokens)} tokens: {tokens[:10]}...")
        print(f"   → First token maps to: '{tokenizer.decode([tokens[0]])}'")
        
        # Educational insight: show boundary effects
        if len(tokens) > 1:
            print(f"   💡 Token boundary: '{tokenizer.decode([tokens[0], tokens[1]])}'")
```

### Learning-Focused Error Handling
Design error messages that teach debugging skills:

```python
def validate_embedding_dimensions(embeddings: np.ndarray, expected_dim: int) -> None:
    """Educational validation that explains dimensional mismatches."""
    if embeddings.shape[-1] != expected_dim:
        actual_dim = embeddings.shape[-1]
        print(f"❌ Dimension Mismatch!")
        print(f"   Expected: {expected_dim} dimensions")
        print(f"   Got: {actual_dim} dimensions")
        print(f"   🔧 Fix: Check your embedding model configuration")
        print(f"   💡 Common cause: Model version mismatch")
        raise ValueError(f"Embedding dimension mismatch: {actual_dim} != {expected_dim}")
```

### Development Environment
Our setup assumes:
- Windows development with PowerShell as the primary shell
- Python 3.12.5 running in a dedicated virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Dependencies managed through pinned `requirements.txt` versions
- API credentials loaded from environment variables for security

## Learning Support Strategies

### Daily Learning Integration
- Connect new concepts to previously covered material
- Suggest practical exercises that reinforce theoretical understanding
- Provide debugging scenarios that teach troubleshooting methodology
- Create assessment questions that test application rather than memorization

### Weekly Milestone Tracking
Create checkpoints that validate conceptual understanding:

```python
def week_2_concept_check():
    """
    Self-assessment for Week 2: Language Model Fundamentals
    Tests practical understanding rather than memorization.
    """
    print("🎯 Week 2 Concept Validation")
    
    # Practical tokenization challenge
    challenge_text = "The AI model's tokenizer splits text differently than expected."
    
    print(f"\n📋 Challenge: Analyze this text's tokenization:")
    print(f"   Text: '{challenge_text}'")
    print(f"   Task: Predict where token boundaries will occur")
    print(f"   Hint: Look for subword patterns and punctuation")
    
    # Interactive learning prompt
    user_prediction = input("Your prediction (token count): ")
    
    # Educational feedback
    actual_tokens = encode_with_explanation(challenge_text)
    print(f"\n✅ Learning Check:")
    print(f"   Your prediction: {user_prediction}")
    print(f"   Actual count: {len(actual_tokens)}")
    print(f"   💡 Key insight: {get_tokenization_insight(actual_tokens)}")
```

### Concept Bridge Building
Help learners connect disparate AI concepts:

```python
def connect_embeddings_to_attention():
    """
    Educational demonstration showing how embeddings flow into attention mechanisms.
    Bridges Week 2 (embeddings) with Week 3 (attention) concepts.
    """
    print("🌉 Bridging Concepts: Embeddings → Attention")
    
    # Step 1: Create meaningful embeddings
    words = ["king", "queen", "man", "woman"]
    embeddings = create_demo_embeddings(words)
    
    print("📊 Input embeddings (simplified):")
    for word, emb in zip(words, embeddings):
        print(f"   {word:6}: {emb[:3]}... (dim: {len(emb)})")
    
    # Step 2: Show attention computation
    attention_scores = compute_simple_attention(embeddings)
    
    print("\n🔍 Attention relationships:")
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        similar_word = words[np.argmax(attention_scores[i])]
        score = attention_scores[i].max()
        print(f"   {word} ↔ {similar_word} (similarity: {score:.3f})")
    
    print("\n💡 Key insight: Embeddings capture meaning, attention finds relationships!")
```

### Progressive Skill Building
- Start explanations with intuitive analogies before technical details
- Design exercises that build complexity incrementally
- Include common pitfalls and how to recognize them
- Suggest extensions that encourage creative exploration

### Contextual Assistance
- Reference the 45-day curriculum structure when providing guidance
- Adapt explanations to the learner's current position in the journey
- Connect abstract concepts to concrete implementation examples
- Recommend related topics for deeper investigation

## Interaction Enhancement

### Prompt Template Integration
Our `.github/prompts/` directory contains specialized templates for:
- Code explanation requests with educational focus
- Learning path progression and concept review
- Project development with teaching objectives
- Research exploration for advanced topics
- Troubleshooting that builds debugging skills

### Effective Communication Patterns
When providing assistance:
- Begin with the conceptual "why" before the implementation "how"
- Include multiple approaches with trade-off explanations  
- Provide concrete examples that learners can modify and experiment with
- Suggest verification methods to confirm understanding

### Learning Conversation Starters
Initiate deeper exploration with these approaches:

```text
🎯 Exploration Prompt: "Let's discover why this works..."
Instead of: "Here's the tokenizer code"
Try: "Let's explore why different tokenizers produce different results for the same text"

🔧 Hands-on Challenge: "What happens if we change..."
Instead of: "This is how attention works"
Try: "What happens if we modify the attention weights? Let's experiment and observe"

🤔 Critical Thinking: "How would you debug this..."
Instead of: "The error is in line 15"
Try: "You're seeing unexpected embeddings. How would you investigate what's happening?"

💡 Connection Making: "This relates to yesterday's concept because..."
Instead of: "Here's today's new topic"
Try: "Today's transformers build directly on yesterday's attention—here's how they connect"
```

### Adaptive Explanation Levels
Tailor explanations to learner progression:

```python
def explain_attention_mechanism(learner_week: int) -> str:
    """
    Adaptive explanation that grows with learner's knowledge.
    Week 1-2: Basic intuition, Week 3-4: Mathematical details, Week 5+: Implementation
    """
    explanations = {
        "week_1_2": """
        🌟 Attention is like a spotlight in a dark room.
        It helps the AI decide which words to "pay attention to" when processing text.
        Think of reading a sentence and automatically focusing on the most important words.
        """,
        
        "week_3_4": """
        🔢 Attention computes similarity scores between words using dot products.
        Each word gets to "vote" on how relevant other words are to understanding it.
        The softmax function converts these votes into probabilities that sum to 1.
        """,
        
        "week_5_plus": """
        ⚙️ Multi-head attention runs multiple attention computations in parallel:
        
        for head in range(num_heads):
            Q, K, V = linear_projections(x, head)
            attention_output = softmax(Q @ K.T / sqrt(d_k)) @ V
        
        This captures different types of relationships simultaneously.
        """
    }
    
    if learner_week <= 2:
        return explanations["week_1_2"]
    elif learner_week <= 4:
        return explanations["week_3_4"]
    else:
        return explanations["week_5_plus"]
```

### Quality Assurance for Learning
Code should be:
- Immediately readable by someone learning AI concepts
- Modular enough to understand one piece at a time
- Robust with helpful error messages that guide correction
- Commented to explain both the "what" and the "why"

## Development Best Practices

### Educational Script Architecture
Create command-line tools that teach through interaction:

```python
def create_tokenization_explorer():
    """
    Educational CLI that teaches tokenization through hands-on experimentation.
    Example of how to build learning into tool design.
    """
    import argparse
    
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description="🔤 Interactive Tokenization Explorer",
        epilog="Discover how different tokenizers handle the same text!",
        formatter_class=argparse.RawDescriptionHelpFormatter
    )
    
    parser.add_argument('text', 
                       help='Text to tokenize and analyze')
    parser.add_argument('--compare', nargs='+', 
                       default=['gpt2', 'bert-base-uncased'],
                       help='Tokenizers to compare (default: gpt2, bert-base-uncased)')
    parser.add_argument('--explain', action='store_true',
                       help='Show detailed explanations of tokenization choices')
    parser.add_argument('--visualize', action='store_true',
                       help='Create visual representation of token boundaries')
    
    # Add learning-focused help examples
    parser.epilog = """
    🎓 Learning Examples:
      python tokenize_explore.py "Hello world!" --explain
      python tokenize_explore.py "AI tokenization" --compare gpt2 t5-base --visualize
      python tokenize_explore.py "模型" --explain  # Test non-English text
    
    💡 Try different text types to see how tokenizers handle:
      - Punctuation and special characters
      - Non-English languages  
      - Technical terms vs common words
      - Very long vs very short texts
    """
    
    return parser
```

### Learning-Oriented Testing Patterns
Design tests that reinforce understanding:

```python
def test_embedding_similarity_educational():
    """
    Test that doubles as a learning exercise about embedding behavior.
    Shows both expected behavior and common misconceptions.
    """
    # Setup: Create embeddings for related words
    words = ["happy", "joyful", "sad", "angry"]
    embeddings = get_word_embeddings(words)
    
    # Learning checkpoint 1: Positive emotions should cluster
    happy_joy_similarity = cosine_similarity(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])
    assert happy_joy_similarity > 0.5, f"""
    🤔 Unexpected similarity between 'happy' and 'joyful': {happy_joy_similarity:.3f}
    
    💡 Expected: > 0.5 (since both are positive emotions)
    🔧 Check: Are you using the right embedding model?
    📚 Concept: Semantic embeddings should group similar meanings
    """
    
    # Learning checkpoint 2: Opposite emotions should be distinct
    happy_sad_similarity = cosine_similarity(embeddings[0], embeddings[2])
    assert happy_sad_similarity < 0.3, f"""
    🤔 'Happy' and 'sad' are too similar: {happy_sad_similarity:.3f}
    
    💡 Expected: < 0.3 (opposite emotions should be distant)
    🔧 Debug: Try visualizing these embeddings in 2D
    📚 Concept: Embedding space should reflect semantic relationships
    """
    
    print("✅ Embedding similarity test passed!")
    print(f"   Happy-Joyful: {happy_joy_similarity:.3f} (semantically close)")
    print(f"   Happy-Sad: {happy_sad_similarity:.3f} (semantically distant)")
```
