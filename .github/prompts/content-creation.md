# Content Creation Prompts

## Original Educational Content Development

```text
I need to create completely original educational content for: [TOPIC]

Following our zero-copy policy, help me develop:
1. Fresh analogies and explanations that haven't been used before
2. Unique code examples with custom scenarios and naming
3. Original interactive exercises that build understanding progressively
4. Custom terminology that enhances learning (like "Discovery Laboratory")
5. Innovative visualization approaches using ASCII art

Requirements:
- No reproduction of existing tutorial content
- Self-contained explanations with no external dependencies
- Educational focus with hands-on learning components
- Perfect alignment with docs/daily-guides/ and notebooks/weekly/ structure
```

## Interactive Learning Function Design

```text
Design an original interactive learning function for: [CONCEPT]

Create a function that:
1. Demonstrates the concept through hands-on experimentation
2. Includes meaningful parameter variations for exploration
3. Provides educational visualizations or outputs
4. Teaches through transparency in implementation
5. Offers extension opportunities for deeper learning

Focus on pedagogical design that illuminates understanding rather than just functionality.
```

## Self-Contained Daily Guide Creation

```text
Create a complete daily learning guide for: [TOPIC] (Week [X], Day [Y])

Requirements:
1. Completely self-contained content with no archived references
2. Perfect 1:1 mapping potential with corresponding notebook
3. Progressive complexity building from previous days
4. Original examples and scenarios specific to this learning environment
5. Interactive exercise descriptions that guide hands-on exploration

Structure should support our single source of truth approach with docs/daily-guides/ and notebooks/weekly/.
```

## Zero-Copy Educational Examples

```text
Generate completely original educational examples for: [AI CONCEPT]

Create examples that:
1. Avoid common tutorial patterns or datasets
2. Use custom text samples like "The AI model preprocesses tokenization patterns efficiently"
3. Design unique problem scenarios that haven't appeared in standard educational materials
4. Build word families like ["swimming", "debugging", "preprocessing"] for pattern exploration
5. Create fresh programming challenges that illuminate concepts through novel approaches

All examples must be completely original and educationally focused.
```

## Original Terminology and Concept Development

```text
Develop original educational terminology for: [CONCEPT AREA]

Create distinctive terms that:
1. Enhance learning through memorable naming
2. Reflect our unique educational approach
3. Build on our existing terminology like "Discovery Laboratory", "Morphological Intelligence"
4. Support progressive concept building
5. Avoid copying existing educational frameworks

Focus on terms that make complex concepts more accessible while maintaining technical accuracy.
