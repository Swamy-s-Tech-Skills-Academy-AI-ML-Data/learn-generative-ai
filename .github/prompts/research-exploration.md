# Research and Exploration Prompts

## Concept Deep Dive

```text
I want to deeply understand: [GENERATIVE AI CONCEPT]

Create a structured exploration:
1. Break down the concept into 5 fundamental building blocks
2. For each block, explain the intuition behind it
3. Show how it connects to broader AI/ML principles
4. Create hands-on experiments to test understanding
5. Identify common variations and when to use them
6. Design a teaching explanation for someone else

Focus on building intuitive understanding, not just technical details.
```

## Implementation Analysis

```text
I'm studying different approaches to: [SPECIFIC TECHNIQUE]

Compare and contrast approaches:
1. Identify the core problem each method solves
2. Analyze computational and memory trade-offs
3. Explain when each approach excels or struggles
4. Create simple examples showing key differences
5. Design experiments to measure performance differences
6. Suggest hybrid approaches that combine strengths

Emphasize practical decision-making criteria.
