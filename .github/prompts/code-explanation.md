# Code Explanation Prompts

## For Tokenization Examples

```
Explain this tokenization code step by step for someone learning language models:

[INSERT CODE HERE]

Break down:
1. What tokenization strategy is being used
2. How the vocabulary is built or loaded
3. What happens to out-of-vocabulary words
4. Any special tokens and their purpose
5. Performance implications of these choices

Focus on educational clarity rather than implementation details.
```

## For Embedding Examples

```
Help me understand this embedding implementation:

[INSERT CODE HERE]

Explain:
1. How semantic relationships are captured
2. The role of dimensionality in the embedding space
3. What similarity metrics are being used and why
4. How these embeddings would perform on different tasks
5. Practical trade-offs in embedding design

Use analogies where helpful for conceptual understanding.
```

## For Agent Pattern Examples

```
Analyze this AI agent implementation pattern:

[INSERT CODE HERE]

Break down:
1. What agent pattern is demonstrated (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, etc.)
2. How state is managed between agent steps
3. What makes this approach effective or ineffective
4. Potential failure modes and how to address them
5. Real-world scenarios where this pattern excels

Focus on the conceptual framework rather than syntax.
