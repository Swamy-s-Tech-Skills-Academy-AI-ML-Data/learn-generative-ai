# Learning Path Prompts

## Daily Learning Focus

```text
I'm on Day [X] of a 90-day generative AI learning path. Today's topic is "[TOPIC]" (docs/daily-guides/week##/day##-topic.md).

Help me:
1. Create 3 practical exercises to reinforce today's concepts
2. Design a mini-project that applies what I learned
3. Generate 5 follow-up questions that will deepen my understanding
4. Suggest real-world examples that illustrate these concepts
5. Create a one-page summary template I can fill out

Focus on hands-on application using the interactive functions in notebooks/weekly/week##/day##-topic.ipynb.
```

## Concept Connection

```text
I just learned about [CONCEPT A] yesterday and [CONCEPT B] today in my generative AI studies.

Help me connect these concepts:
1. How do these two ideas build on each other?
2. Create a visual diagram showing their relationship
3. Design an example that uses both concepts together
4. Explain potential conflicts or trade-offs between them
5. Suggest a practical project that demonstrates their synergy

Make connections explicit and actionable for learning.
```

## Progress Assessment

```text
I've completed [X] days of my 90-day generative AI learning path covering: [LIST TOPICS] from docs/daily-guides/week##/.

Create a comprehensive review:
1. Design a self-assessment quiz with scenario-based questions
2. Identify knowledge gaps I should address
3. Suggest projects that integrate multiple concepts I've learned
4. Create a practical application challenge for my skill level
5. Recommend next steps to deepen my expertise

Focus on applied knowledge using the interactive exploration functions in my weekly notebooks.
