# Project Development Prompts

## Script Enhancement

```text
I have a Python script for generative AI experimentation:

[INSERT CODE HERE]

Help me improve it for educational use:
1. Add clear docstrings and type hints for learning clarity
2. Create error handling that teaches debugging skills
3. Add logging that shows the learning process step-by-step
4. Include parameter validation with educational error messages
5. Design configuration options that demonstrate trade-offs

Prioritize educational value and code quality over complexity.
```

## Documentation Creation

```text
I need to document this generative AI concept: [CONCEPT]

Create educational documentation that includes:
1. A clear definition with everyday analogies
2. Step-by-step breakdown of how it works
3. Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
4. Practical examples with expected outcomes
5. Progressive exercises from basic to advanced
6. Troubleshooting guide for common issues

Write for someone with basic Python knowledge learning AI concepts.
```

## Testing Strategy

```text
I'm building educational examples for: [TOPIC]

Design a testing approach that:
1. Validates correctness without revealing implementation details
2. Includes edge cases that teach important lessons
3. Provides meaningful error messages for learning
4. Tests both happy path and failure scenarios
5. Demonstrates best practices in AI development
6. Can be run easily in a Windows/PowerShell environment

Focus on teaching good development practices while ensuring code quality.
